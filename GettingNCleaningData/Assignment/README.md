# Getting And Cleaning Data Course Project

## Introduction
This project is the work from Coursera Course "Getting and Cleaning Data". The purpose of this project is to demonstrate student's ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The data used in this project is collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available on [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), and you can download the [raw data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) for the project.
